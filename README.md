# Space-invaders-project
Final project for How to Code 1

This file was started from the starter file provided by the instructor, which included the constant definitions and some data definitions, although additional of both were added during development.  All functions are original.

The file is written in racket and produces a functional space invaders game.  There are randomly generated invaders that travel down on a diagonal.  You have tank you can move back and forth with the arrow keys and use space to fire a missile upwards.  The invaders are destroyed when hit with a missile.

The game does not stop when an invader reaches the bottom; it just keeps going.  It consists of only the one level and speed, so stopping the game for a "loss" didn't make much sense.
